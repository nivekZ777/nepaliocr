## OCR ##
This OCR engine is built in .NET Framework


The OCR has been built in the following languages:

**.net framework 1.1 (Visual C++ 2003, Visual Studio 2003)**

**.net framework 4.0 (C#, Visual Studio 2010)**

Warning: This software is a research initiative and may not be complete. It is here only for research values, hoping that someone might use this to create Hindi / Nepali / or any Devanagari OCR in future.

The original work was performed at Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya [from 2005-2008](http://madanpuraskar.org)
